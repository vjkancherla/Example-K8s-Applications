ASDF
=======
- asdf is a tool version manager. 
- All tool version definitions are contained within one file (.tool-versions) which you can check in 
  to your project's Git repository to share with your team, ensuring everyone is using the exact same versions of tools.

".tool-versions" FILE
=========================
- .tool-versions is the file that stores version specific tool information for ASDF to use
- Global defaults can be set in the file $HOME/.tool-versions
- Whenever .tool-versions file is present in a directory, the tool versions it declares will be used in that directory and any subdirectories.

EXAMPLES:
$HOME/.tool-versions
----
java openjdk-19.0.2
---
Defines that java-openjdk-19.0.2 should be used globally


PWD/.tool-versions
----
java system
----
Overrides the global default for the current directory and its subdirectories (uses system installed java)


PWD/.tool-versions
----
java openjdk-20.0.2
----
Overrides the global default for the current directory and its subdirectories to use openjdk-20.0.2
NOTE: You will prompted to run "asdf install java openjdk-20.0.2" to install the version if its not already available



INSTALLING ALL VERSION LISTED IN ".tool-versions" FILE
============================================================
You can create a ".tools-versions" file like below and check-it-in into Git.

People can then checkout the repo and install all the tools at the right versions by running:
